Introduction: 

Agriculture holds a pivotal role in today's world, impacting various aspects of society, 
and the environment. In the face of rapidly evolving climatic conditions and the increasing 
demand for food, the agricultural sector must continuously innovate to ensure sustainability 
and productivity. Farmers may operate more profitably, productively, safely, and sustainably 
with the help of modern agriculture technology. Effective crop selection, a vital aspect of farm 
planning, can enhance productivity and minimize losses. To aid farmers in making informed 
decisions, Crop Recommendation Interface leveraging Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. By 
analysing soil characteristics such as Nitrogen (N), Phosphorous (P), Potassium (K), pH levels, 
Temperature, Humidity and Rainfall we can recommend optimal crops.

The Role of Soil Minerals: 

1. Potassium: Potassium is a vital nutrient for plant growth, contributing to root 
development, disease resistance, and overall plant health. Soil tests reveal potassium 
levels, helping the system suggest crops that thrive in either high or low potassium 
conditions.

3. Nitrogen: Nitrogen is essential for chlorophyll production and overall plant growth. 
Soil nitrogen content influences crop recommendations, as different crops have varying 
nitrogen requirements.

5. Phosphorous: Phosphorous is crucial for root development and flowering. Soil 
phosphorous levels guide the system in suggesting crops that can optimize the available 
phosphorous.
